# reactproject
React/Redux store project


This project is intended for use with my father-in-law's future aquarium shop.

To Install:

cd to jsfrontend:
run npm install and npm start

in separate terminal, cd to railsbackend
run bundle install, raild db:migrate, rails db:seed and then rails s -p 4000

The front end of this project is designed to run with a backend that runs out of port 4000.

The project is a basic storefront app using react.
